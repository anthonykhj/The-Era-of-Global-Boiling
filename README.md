# The-Era-of-Global-Boiling
An analysis of EV adoption and emissions data to combat 'global boiling'â€”using MySQL and NoSQL.

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project analyses electric vehicle (EV) adoption, charging infrastructure, and COâ‚‚ emissions to address the UNâ€™s call for urgent climate action. Using **SQL (MySQL)** and **NoSQL (MongoDB)**, we explore:
- Electric vehicle adoption trends
- Charging infrastructure distribution  
- CO2 emissions comparisons  
- Policy implications for Singapore's 2030 EV goals
